# NASA-Machine-Learning
Create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.  Conducted feature selection, data scaling.  Two classification models, Support Vector and Neural Network, were trained, hyptertuned, and tested.  


## Data Preprocessing

•	Clean data
•	Perform feature selection
•	Scale numerical data

## Macine Learning

•	Classification Models: Support Vector and Neural Networks
•	Hypertune Models
•	Compare Models
