# NASA-Machine-Learning
Created supervised machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.  Conducted feature selection and data scaling.  Two classification models, Support Vector and Neural Network, were trained, hyptertuned, and tested.  

## Dataset
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system, otherwise known as  "exo-planets".  The dataset included just under 7000 records classified as either "confirmed", "false positive", or "candidate" and 40 features.
